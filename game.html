      <h2>How to play</h2>
      <p>To play, simply click on an empty square (a button)</p>
      <p>Every square where a move is played,<br>
         all squares 1 step vertically or horizontally away<br>
         become part of the board (if they aren't already).</p>
      <details>
         <summary>Examples:</summary>
         <p>I recommend just trying these out above.</p>
         <p class = "monospace">
            <br>&nbsp;X__<br>&nbsp;___<br>&nbsp;___<br>
            <br>&nbsp;_<br>_X__<br>&nbsp;___<br>&nbsp;___<br>
            <br>
            <br>&nbsp;_<br>_XO_<br>&nbsp;___<br>&nbsp;___<br>
            <br>&nbsp;__<br>_XO_<br>&nbsp;___<br>&nbsp;___<br>
            <br>
            <br>&nbsp;_<br>_XO_<br>&nbsp;X__<br>&nbsp;___<br>
            <br>&nbsp;__<br>_XO_<br>_X__<br>&nbsp;___<br>
         </p>
      </details>
      <p>Hence the name, tic tac toe grow.</p>
      <p>If the board grows too big, you can use the mapControl buttons on the right</p>
      <p>For example, the "up" button moves the whole board up.</p>
      <p>This can actually be quite unintuitive,<br>
         since when you click on "up", you move the board up,<br>
         but you (e.g. your mouse) moves down in comparison.<br>
         It's kinda like scrolling.</p>
      <p>You win if you get 7 in a row, or a checkmark.</p>
      <p>A checkmark is defined as a region of squares that:</p>
      <ul>
         <li>are all <em>diagonally</em> adjacent to each other</li>
         <li>form a right angle, where
            <ol>
               <li>both sides share a square
               <li>one side is 2 squares long</li>
               <li>the other side is 4 squares long</li>
            </ol>
         </li>
      </ul>
      <details>
         <summary>Example checkmarks:</summary>
         <p class = "monospace">____X<br>___X_<br>X_X__<br>_X___</p>
         <p class = "monospace">_X__<br>X____<br>_X__<br>__X_<br>___X</p>
         <p class = "monospace">
            X_______<br>_X______<br>__X_____<br>___X___X<br>____X_X_<br>_____X__
         </p>
         <p>
            The last one has sides that have more than 2 or 4 squares long, <br>
            but that just makes it more awesome, <br>
            and the rest of the "checkmark" will turn green anyways.
         </p>
      </details>
      <h3>Another note</h3>
      <p>
         If the length is (7 times the width), or vice versa,
         it's a draw.
      </p>
      <details>
         <summary>Technicallly</summary>
         <p>What? No way, the length was 6 times the width,<br>
            but then skipped to 8 times?</p>
         <p>You shouldn't be able to do that.<br>
            If you do, it's a bug so tell me</p>
         <p>Still a draw though.</p>
      </details>
      <h2>More details</h2>
      <p>The game will tell you if it's a win or a draw,<br>
         so you don't have to worry about that</p>
      <p>You can see the width and height in the game info,<br>
         where, eventually (not done yet), you can also...</p>
      <ul>
         <li>See the height of the board</li>
         <li>See the width of the board</li>
         <li>Add to the total number of people</li>
         <li>Also delete some people</li>
         <li>And also name the people</li>
         <li>My code doesn't really care about the names</li>
         <li>And you can also change whose turn it is</li>
         <li>Wow! Just have a bot play</li>
         <li>Or even multiple bots</li>
         <li>Or even the same bot, but multiple times</li>
         <li>Or even the same person multiple times</li>
         <li>Or a different person multiple times</li>
         <li>And you can add a player (different from "person")</li>
         <li>Or delete players</li>
         <li>You can even have humans and bots at the same time</li>
         <li>You can admire the amount of bots there are</li>
         <li>AND MORE</li>
         <li>Free limit: Only 4 players max</li>
         <li>Free limit: Only 2 players... min</li>
         <li>You can breathe easily. It's really easy to breathe.</li>
         <li>Did I mention: Names can be the same?</li>
         <li>Imagine... holding the down arrow key on a dropdown =O</li>
         <li>You can click the words "Player 1" instead of the box!</li>
         <li>You can change the number of players directly</li>
         <li>Or just one by one I guess</li>
         <li>And same thing for the number of humans!</li>
         <li>That's right, changing the number of humans directly</li>
         <li>Or just one by one</li>
         <li>There's so much you could theoretically do</li>
         <li>Imagine... the possibilities XDDDD</li>
         <li>BWAHAHAHAHA sorry I really had fun making this</li>
      </ul>
      <p>By default, it's 1 player against a bot named "random_move"</p>
